```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "collectionB",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "foreignKey",
      as: "results"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$results"
  }
];

db.collectionA.aggregate(pipeline);
```
This code attempts to perform a `$lookup` and then `$unwind` the results.  However, if `collectionB` contains no matching documents for a given document in `collectionA`, the `$unwind` stage will fail, throwing an error. The `$lookup` stage can return an empty array. If you use `$unwind` on an empty array this will cause the operation to stop.

This is not immediately obvious because the error message might not directly point to this condition.  Debugging requires checking the documents in `collectionA` to verify whether any documents have no matching documents in `collectionB`.
